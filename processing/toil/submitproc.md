We have now our `convert-url`{{}} application deployed in our platform, we can submit a processing request.

Once the processing request is submitted, Zoo will invoke Calrissian, which will then create a new Kubernetes namespace in the same Kubernetes cluster where Zoo and the [OGC Process API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/) interface is installed and start there the application jobs.

The jobs will gather the input, execute the processing and in the push the output inside the platform object storage.

From the [OGC Process API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/) interface we will be able to monitor the status of the job and, at the end of its successful completition, retreive its output.

So, let's start to submit a processing request to the convert-url application.

We can check the inputs we need for submittign a processing request for this application from the API via

```
curl -s -S http://zoo.eoepca.local/test/ogc-api/processes/convert-url | jq .inputs
```{{exec}}

As you can see, and as you may recall from the CWL submitted in the previous step, this application requires three inputs: "fn", "url" and "size".

As example, we can just use their default values in the job submission, via

```
JOB_ID=$(
  curl --silent --show-error \
    -X POST http://zoo.eoepca.local/test/ogc-api/processes/convert-url/execution \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Prefer: respond-async" \
    -d @- <<EOF | jq -r '.jobID'
  {
    "inputs": {
      "fn": "resize",
      "url":  "https://eoepca.org/media_portal/images/logo6_med.original.png",
      "size": "50%"
    }
  }
EOF
)
echo "$JOB_ID"
```{{exec}}

the execution returned us a job id, which we are saving in the `$JOB_ID`{{}} variable for later use
