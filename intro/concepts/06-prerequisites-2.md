Now we check again whether all the prerequisites are met. To do this, we run the `check-prerequisites` script again:
```
cd ~/deployment-guide/scripts/infra-prereq
bash check-prerequisites.sh
```{{exec}}

with `no` to the two questions:
```
no
no
```{{exec}}

From the results:
1. Pods can run as `root`
2. Ingress responded successfully
3. ClusterIssuer found
4. PVC 'test-rwx-pvc' successfully bound with ReadWriteMany

All the requirements are satisfied!
