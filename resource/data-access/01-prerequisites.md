Before deploying the Data Access Building Block, we must have the following software and tools:
- Kubernetes >= 1.28
- Helm >= 3.5
- `kubectl` with context set to your cluster
- Ingress controller (e.g., APISIX or nginx)
- TLS issuer (e.g., cert-manager)
- S3-compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO)

Of these, Kubernetes, Helm and `kubectl` command come preinstalled on the KillerCoda platform, nginx ingress controller and minio S3 object storage have already been installed as prerequisites and we won't be using TLS certificates and encryption therefore we do not need cert-manager.

As ususal in this tutorial, we will use the EOEPCA Deployment Guide scripts to help us configuring and deploying our application. 

First, we clone it in our environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/EOEPCA/deployment-guide
```{{exec}}

The Rescource Catalogue deployment scripts are available in the `resource-discovery` directory:
```
cd deployment-guide/scripts/data-access
```{{exec}}

Next, we check whether the prerequisites listed above for installing the Resource Discovery building block are met. The Deployment Guide scripts provide a dedicated script for this task:
```
bash check-prerequisites.sh
```{{exec}}

This will ask a few questions about the Kubernetes cluster configuration and check if all the necessary prerequirements are installed. 

First, we choose th `http` scheme since we are not using certificates and encryption for our tutorial:
```
http
```{{exec}}

We choose the nginx ingress controller:
```
nginx
```{{exec}}

We enter the top-level domain for our EOEPCA services:
```
eoepca.local
```{{exec}}

The storage class is already configured in our Kubernetes cluster and selected as default for our EOEPCA deployment, we don't want to change it:
```
no
```{{exec}}

We also do not need automatically generated certificates or indeed any certificates at all for our tutorial:
```
no
```{{exec}}

Now, since in our tutorial we decided not to use certficates, we can ignore the message:
> Cert-Manager is not installed in the cluster.   
> Please install Cert-Manager: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/   
> If you are manually managing certificates, you can ignore this message.
